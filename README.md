The method of extracting data from websites is called web scraping. It is also called web data extraction or web harvesting.
The purpose of web scraping is to fetch data from any website thereby saving a huge amount of manual labour in collecting data/information.
Thereafter you can perform text analytics to gain insights about the movie from the huge corpus of reviews collected.
We can perform scraping using python with requests and Beautiful Soup. Another package named Scrapy can also be used for the same. In this assignment I used Beautiful Soup for web scraping.
